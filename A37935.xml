         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>My Lord,</hi> All the Miſeries and Confuſions in this Land, (more than fourty Years continuance,) began at <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Church, which is well known by ſad experience, and its Tragical Hiſtory is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with red Capital Letters of Blood, that he who runs may read it; with the blood of his Royal Majeſty, now a glorified Martyr, with the blood of many Nobles and Worthies, and thouſands of other Subjects: therefore the King of kings, in His gracious Providence, with his Vicegerent over theſe Kingdoms, hath placed your Lordſhip in the civil Watch-Tower of this Kingdom, to eſpy and prevent Sedition in the State, and conſequently to have a watchful Eye againſt <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Church; eſpecially ſeing the great fundamental Maxim of ſome in this Kingdom, was not only dangerous to the State conſequentially, and by its tendency, but ſubſtantially ſuch.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:51622:12"/> This anſwer will ſatisfie the moſt rational of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. 3. I anſwer, Bleſsed be the God of order, <hi>who ſtilleth the noiſe of the Seas, the noiſe of their Waves, and the tumult of the People,</hi> Pſal 65. 7. who hath reduced the proud and ſwelling Waters of that deludge of Diſorder, which threatned the overtopping of the Mountains, to abide within their wonted Channels; I wiſh theſe Waters may abate more and as with their Bodies they give external obedience to Order, ſo all this Church may be of one Heart and Soul, keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, it being obſerved, that the refuſing to ſing the <hi>Doxology,</hi> is the moſt known <hi>Sibboleth,</hi> Judg. 12. 6. whereby theſe of the Seperation are known from theſe that are orderly, and the refuſing to ſing it, proves a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of too ſtrong inclination to Separation; Therefore we reſolve to take pains for its refutation, and if this opinion of the unlawfulneſs to ſing the <hi>Doxology</hi> were meerly a ſpeculative queſtion in Divinity, and did not tend to practice, the knowledge thereof might ſafely and prudently be kept up from the Vulgar, for many ſuch queſtions are wiſely kept cloſe within the walls of the Divinity School, which the Vulgar (although they did hear them diſpute in their Mother Tongue) could not understand them: Not the leſs in theſe ſame queſtions the learned can diſpute <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> and be of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Judgements, and yet keep Love and Charity, but this Question anent the <hi>Doxology</hi> tends to Practice, and that in the publick Worſhip of God, and that not only on the Christian Sabbath, but alſo on the Week day, and therefore the refuſing to ſing the <hi>Doxology</hi> is a daily ſtumbling to the Weak.</p>
            <p>If any particular man, or particular metting of Church-men, although they were a Body, Repreſentative of many Particular Churches, yet it were Preſumption in them, to preſs any Duty upon their Chriſtian Brethren, who were not within their Line of Juriſdiction, but ſurely the Singing of the <hi>Doxologie,</hi> is far otherwayes, for it hath the Authority, Approbation and Practiſe of the Univerſal Church, more then 1300.

The weak Lambs, who yet are ſeeking the way to Zion, and to pleaſe God in all good Conſcience, to theſe I am willing to tender the ſincere Milk of the Word, becauſe of the Command of the Great Shepherd of our Souls, <hi>John 21. 15. If you love me, feed my Lambs,</hi> theſe I intreat in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, to conſider the danger of an Erronious Conſcience; For <hi>St. Paul</hi> was once, yet more zealous then ye are, in a wrong way, of which
<pb facs="tcp:51622:13"/> he gave prudent and Chriſtian warning to other Zealots, <hi>Acts 26. 9. I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contraire to the Name of Jeſus of Nazareth, which thing I alſo did:</hi> of which Erroneous Zealot <hi>Jews,</hi> he bears record, <hi>Rom 10. 2. That they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge;</hi> So of you I judge in charity, that your Zeal is ſincere, and abundant, but the defect is in your knowledge; and in ſuch a caſe, the more Zeall, the more danger; and therefore be not Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in underſtanding, <hi>1 Cor. 14. 20. Be no more children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> Eph. 4. 14. Be aware to deſpiſe, or reject the Light of ſound Inſtruction, and ſide no longer with <hi>Antitrinitarians,</hi> and the like Blaſphemous Hereticks, all which the univerſall Church hath declared Excommunicat, as ſuch, from the Communion of Saints, and forgivenneſs of Sins, ſide no more with theſe Monſters. The God of Truth reveall His Truth unto you, and give you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in all things; for to you I owe great compaſſion, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of bowels: As for the 2d. Sort, called Chriſtians, to wit, the cunningly painted Hypocrite, and the openly Prophane, I have a word alloted for them, reſerved till near the cloſe of the Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Here I have an Apologie to make to the Learned, who may object, what needed ſo much to be written, to prove or defend that Practice, which none in the univerſal Church, for 1300. Years did call in queſtion, to whom, in all humility I reply, theſe are not written for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or Reformation of the Learned, in this Point, who ſtand in need of neither, being aſſured, both of the Lawfulneſs, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of this Duty; but they alſo know, that there is too many of late years, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who refuſe to ſing the <hi>Doxologie,</hi> to whom I am reſolved to become all things to them all, whether weak, or more knowing, that by all means, I may gain ſome, for whoſe cauſe I have multiplyed Arguments to prove the lawfulneſſe of the <hi>Doxologie,</hi> having to teach theſe weaned from the Milk, and drawn from the Breaſts, to whom Precept muſt be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Precept, and Lyne upon Lyne, <hi>Iſa. 28. 9, 10</hi> I hope none will ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt uſeth either Tautologie, or Battologie, in the foreſaid <hi>10. verſe,</hi> when he doubles both the Precept and the Lyne; So I have brought, for Information of theſe little Ones, and Lambs of Christ; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon Reaſon redoubled: For as the ſtrong ſhould have their ſtronger Food; So the Bab's their Milk: And ſome be more moved with one Reaſon, and ſome with another; herein I intending that great Poſtorall Duty to do all things for Edyfying, <hi>1 Cor. 14. 26. 2 Cor. 12. 19.</hi> And in Citing modern Divines, I have made moſt uſe of theſe, who will be moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and convincing to the Refuſers of the <hi>Doxologie;</hi> And if at any time, (for defence fo Truth,) I bring Proof from any bygone Practice of themſelves, and their way, I here declare, that it no wayes to irritat, but to bear in the Truth with the more power, my purpoſe being to do all in Love, and what makes for Peace and Healing. The Servant of the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:51622:13"/> muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all Men, apt to Teach, patient, in meekneſs Inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 28. and 25.</p>
            <p>That which is not written in the Vulgar Tongue, in this following little Treatiſe, in a diſtinct Section towards the Right Hand, is intended for the Learned.</p>
            <p>Finally, I ingenuouſly declare, That my firſt and chief End, is the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and I pray, through the Lords bleſſing, it may prove the End, and Eſſect of the work: In the next place, I intend the furtherance of the Peace, and Proſperity of my Mother-church, in Clearing, and Removing of miſtakes, among the Children, at least, to make the Rent and Breach leſs, that the weak might be ſtrengthened, and confirmed in their Judgement, in their Singing the <hi>Doxologie,</hi> that the Scruplous may be informed, the Averſe convinced, and Reclaimed, Contentions and Swellings pacified, and removed, as far as Relates to the <hi>Doxologie,</hi> that all with one Heart and Mouth may Sing, Glory to God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and as my God and Saviour was ſubject to his Bleſsed <hi>Virgin Mother,</hi> and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to be meek and lowly, <hi>Matth. 11. 29.</hi> So in all due humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as one of the leaſt of the Sons of my Mother Church, what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on this Subject, in ſubmiſſion, I lay it down at her Feet, fully reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obey the Law of my Father in Heaven, which is not to deſpiſe, or forſake the Law of my Spiritual Mother on Earth. <hi>Prov. 1. 8.</hi> and <hi>Prov 6. 20.</hi> That our Father in Heaven may have all the Glory, His Church Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the Lambs of Chriſt their Milk, which ſhall be my deſire, and Prayer at the Throne of Grace.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51622:16"/> Sums of Chriſtian Faith commonly called Creeds, that before theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Catechume in received Baptiſm, they were to give a confeſſion of their Faith contained in their Creed; in all which Creeds, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Church, whether longer or ſhorter; and in their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms, the Doctrine of the Trinity was a ſpecial part, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Synod of Divines at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in their leſſer Catechiſm have not omitted the Trinity: So the reformed <hi>French</hi> Church in <hi>Geneva</hi> have a little Catechiſm, containing only twenty one ſhort Queſtions, on which they examine theſe who are at firſt to be admitted to the Lords Table, which little Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm begins with the Trinity, and is bound in with their <hi>French</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Bible, printed at <hi>Geneva</hi> 1567.</p>
               <p>The Sacred Trinity being the Program of Chriſtian Baptiſm, proved the ſtrong and invincible Fort of the Chriſtian Faith in the Trinity of Perſons in the Godhead, againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and other <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titrinitarian</hi> Hereticks: wherefore <hi>Socinus,</hi> who hath drunk much deeper in the poyſonable Cup of Blaſphemy againſt the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity then the old <hi>Arrians,</hi> hath very ſlightingly written of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>The ſecond great Myſtery of Chriſtian Religion, is, that the Word was made Fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. and this the Holy Ghoſt calls the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the Fleſh, 1 <hi>Timoth. chap. 3. verſ.</hi> 16. which Myſtery, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Word, the ſecond
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51622:17"/> Perſon, God the Son was incarnate, and not the Father, or the Holy Ghoſt; this cannot be known and believed aright, until firſt we know &amp; believe that there are three diſtinct Perſons in the Godhead, therefore our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. joyns theſe two together, <hi>This is life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent;</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Coloſſ. 2. 2. <hi>to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be objected, that it ſeems to be a hard ſaying, That the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Faith in God, and three Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and in Chriſt God and Man in one Perſon, is neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Seing both theſe are profound Myſteries, ſo far above Humane Reaſon and Capacity, I anſwer, firſt, Not only theſe two are great Myſteries, but alſo the whole Goſpel is a Divine Revelation of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued tract of Myſteries, <hi>Mark 4. 11. Rom. 16. 25. 26. Eph. 3. 9, 16, 19. Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 26, 27. called the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. for there is no other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved, but the Name of Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. who is the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. the Author of Eternal Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. and the Goſpel is called the Knowledge of Salvation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 77. the Word of Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 26. the Way of Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 17. the Salvation of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 28. the Power of God to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. the great Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. ſo that whoſoever will not believe theſe Goſpel Myſteries, is damned. I anſwer ſecondly, that to Divine and Saving Faith, as ſuch demonſtrative knowledge in the Logical Senſe, far leſs comprehenſive knowledge is required; but the Lord condeſcending to Mans Humane weak Capacity, accepts of Faith, albeit apprehenſive Knowledge go before it, not alwayes requiring that they know how ſuch a thing is true, but that howſoever it is true: And becauſe of the myſteriouſneſs of theſe Goſpel Divine Truths, there is a neceſſity for a Chriſtian to deny himſelf, before he can follow Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 24. deny his carnal Wit and corrupt Reaſon, therefore in the Lord's work of Man's Converſion, in which He applys His exceeding great and Mighty Power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. He caſts down Imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, and bringeth into captivity every thought unto the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. where albeit the Almighty Hand of God is firſt in order, and chief in the work, yet the Chriſtian himſelf, willingly conſents to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate all his carnal Imaginations and Thoughts, and over the belly of them all, gives the aſſent of Faith to the Myſteries of the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Truth of God, who is infinite in Truth, and cannot Lie; for he who piouſly and humbly captivates his Thoughts to Chriſt, will ſtop the mouth of all Objections of corrupt Reaſon, with <hi>Abraham,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51622:17"/> againſt hope believing in hope,</hi> Rom. 4. 18. which aſſent of Faith gives God far more Glory, then the aſſent of Science, which flows naturally from the force of that natural Light, born in by the knowledge of the Cauſe; but the aſſent of Faith is ſupernatural, being a ſupernatural Grace and gift of God, with all its degrees: And becauſe the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Trinity, and Chriſt's Incarnation, were ſo high above Man's corrupt Reaſon, therefore in the firſt 400. Years of the New Teſtament, Satan wrought mightily in the Children of Diſobedience, and did find it an eaſie work to raiſe up many blaſphemous Hereticks, who in the pride of their undaunted Heart, refuſed to captivate their corrupt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe the Myſteries of the Trinity and Incarnation, which were not contrary to Reaſon, but above it.</p>

               <p>In the ſecond Part of the Chapter follows the manyfold, and ſade evils, both of Sin and Miſery that were cauſed by theſe Blaſphemous Hereticks.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord of Glory was in a High Degree diſhonoured, and greatly provoked to anger; So that the Learned, and Pious, in there conſuming Zeal, and holy Indignation, did admire the Lords long Suffering Patience; crying out, <hi>O God how long ſhal the adverſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? ſhall the enemy blaſpheme thy name for ever?</hi> Pſal. 74. 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Too many followed thoſe Blaſpheming Hereticks, and their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious wayes; and that often in the particular Kingdom, where their Blaſphemy was firſt invented, and ſometimes their Peſtilentious Breath ſpread abroad, and infected moe Kingdoms with their Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Satan, and the power of Darkneſſe ſometimes ſeemed to triumph, and Wickedneſs to lift up it's horn on high, and the ſmoak of the Bottomleſs Pit to darken the Face of the Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many weak Chriſtians, and tender Lambs of Chriſt ſtaggered, and ſtumbled, being troubled with the Words of Hereticks, almoſt to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51622:19"/> the ſubverting of their Souls, now in a fainting condition, their hearts, being moved as the Trees of the Wood with a mighty Wind? and many in danger to periſh, for whom Chriſt died.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſade condition of theſe Flocks, no doubt, moved their Paſtors, in holy Zeal, like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to wiſh theſe incorrigible He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, who did what in them lay, to deſtroy the Flock of God, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed from the Lord, as they were cut off from the Church, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 12. even theſe wandring Stars, to whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs-for ever, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sometime unſtable Church men, were Deceived, and Inſnared, who, when Learned, Eloquent, or both, they prevailed mightily, both in City and Countrey; Like that time, when the Great Red Dragons Tail, did draw the third part of the Stars of Heaven, and caſt them to the Earth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 3 4. Hence a fearfull Rent, and Schiſme was made in the Church; Hence came Biting, Devouring, and Conſuming one another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Pagan,</hi> were hardened in their Errors, and a ſtumbling block inſuperable laid in the way of their Converſion.</p>

The frequent and beautiful meetings of the Flocks of Chriſt, being Seduced, Diminiſhed, and Scattered, cauſed their Faithful Paſtors to offend, Mourn and Lament theſe of their Flocks that had fallen; Like the Loving Mother, weeping over, not One only, but Many of Her Children dying together: And to ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When ſometime the Faction of Hereticks grew ſtrong, as in particular of the <hi>Arians,</hi> having, by the ſubtility of the Serpent, obtained the Secular Power to joyn, and ſide with them, and ſo did many Years Perſecute the true Church of Chriſt, not only to the ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Goods Impriſonment, or Baniſhment, but alſo many thouſands having ſuffered Cruel Torments, at laſt Sealled the True Faith of Chriſt with their Blood and Death: Of which <hi>Arian</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt the true Church of Chriſt, we intend hereafter to give you a more particular accompt.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS in the firſt 300. Years after our Lord's Aſcenſion, His Church was ſore vexed by Ten bloody Perſecutions, raiſed by <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperours, and moleſted by <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> Hereticks, of which we have given you a ſhort view in the former Chapter; So in this fourth Century, Satan the Father of Lies, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 324. filled the Heart of <hi>Arius</hi> (a proud Preſbyter in <hi>Alexandria)</hi> with Blaſphemies againſt the ſecond Perſon of the Bleſſed Trinity, wherefore, the famous Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> conſiſting of 318. Biſhops, conveened partly for examining and confounding of <hi>Arius</hi> Error in the Year 325. where after long diſpute granted to the Adverſary, his blaſphemous Error was condemned and he Excommunicate: Notwithſtanding, thereafter his Errors ſpread like a Gangren, and that chiefly by occaſion of two Emperours <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> and <hi>Valence,</hi> whom the <hi>Arians</hi> ſeduced to their Hereſie, and ſo the <hi>Arian</hi> obtaining the Arm, and Countenance of the Civil Power to their wicked Faction, they left no mean uneſſeyed to encreaſe and ſtrengthen their Party, and ſpread their Poiſon, which we intend to treat of in this Chapter, in theſe particulars.</p>

What true Chriſtian can read the Perjury, Falſhood and helliſh Cruelty of the <hi>Arian,</hi> and their atheiſtical profaning of the Lord's Supper, and not look upon them as incarnate devils, againſt theſe antichriſtian and profane bloody <hi>Arians,</hi> who blaſphemed both the Son and Holy Ghoſt. The Orthodox Church were moſt zealous to defend the Truth, and for that cauſe, to ſing the Doxology in their publick Worſhip, exactly according to the words of the Holy Scriptures: For then the <hi>Arian</hi> alſo keeped the ſinging of their own Doxology, but it was different from the Orthodox and Holy Scriptures.

               <p>As the Orthodox Church, during the time of the <hi>Arian</hi> Perſecution, notwithſtanding of all the cruelty uſed againſt them, the Church-men gave Teſtimony againſt the <hi>Arian,</hi> by Preaching, Writing, and Diſputes, and both the Church-men and their Flocks by valiant ſuffering of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51622:24"/> and ſealing the Truth with their Blood: So the Lord Himſelf from Heaven, divers ways did bear Teſtimony againſt the <hi>Arian,</hi> and for His Truth; firſt, in granting Signs and Wonders to be done by the Orthodox Church in this fourth Century, and in the <hi>Arians</hi> hotteſt Perſecution, when in the mean time, the <hi>Arians</hi> had no Miracles amongſt them, nor did they pretend to any; and although they had pretended to work Miracles, yet the <hi>Arians</hi> Miracles had been nothing but Satans lying Wonders: But God honoured even the perſecute Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox to work glorious Miracles; for inſtance, the <hi>Arians</hi> having baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Orthodox Chriſtians to a remote Iſland in the Sea, where the <hi>Pagans</hi> worſhipped the Devil, ſeated in a Grove, theſe baniſhed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians firſt caſt <note n="a" place="margin">Socrat. <hi>lib. 4. cap.</hi> 19.</note> out the Devil out of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Prieſts Daughter, then converted her and her Parents, and at laſt the whole <hi>Pagans</hi> of that Iſland to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith.

               <p>A ſecond inſtance, <hi>Moſes</hi> an Orthodox Chriſtian was famous for working of Miracles, who coming to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> refuſed to receive Conſecration to a Biſhoprick from <hi>Lucius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>

               <p>As the Lord did bear Teſtimony to the Orthodox Chriſtians, and their Faith, by giving them the gift of Miracles, and not to the <hi>Arian,</hi> ſo did that Lord as Judge of the World declare and manifeſt His Wrath againſt the chief <hi>Arian</hi> Perſecuters in this Century.

               <p>In this Chapter at Page 24. we ſpoke anent the addition put to the Doxology, mentioned in the Council of <hi>Vauſon (as it was in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.)</hi> If ſome object that that addition is obſcure, and does not clearly aſſert the Eternity of the Trinity before the World began, as <hi>(for ever)</hi> in the cloſe of the Doxology aſſerts the Eternity of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for ever after the World: I anſwer, we have proven indenyably from the Church Hiſtory, that theſe words <hi>(as it was in the Beginning)</hi> in the Doxology are taken from the firſt Chapter and firſt Verſe of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, which words, the Holy Ghoſt there made uſe of, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Co-eternity of the Son with the Father, and therefore that ſame Text was uſed by the Fathers of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> who denied the preceeding Eternity of the Son with the Father; and the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Syrmium</hi> againſt the <hi>Arians</hi> writ, that <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> who were blaſphemous Hereticks in the days of the Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> denied the Godhead of the Son, and conſequently his Co-eternity with the Father: And therefore as the ſcope of all St.

                  <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel is chiefly to prove Chriſt's Godhead againſt theſe two He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, ſo albeit that firſt Propoſition, <hi>in the Beginning was the Word,</hi> taken alone, by way of ſeparation from the following words, will not prove any Eternity or Co-eternity with the Father; yet joyn it in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence with the following words, and that will clear the right Senſe of this Beginning in the firſt of <hi>John,</hi> and the Beginning mentioned in the Doxology, and ye will find it the ſame in Senſe with the firſt words in holy Writ, <hi>Geneſ. 1. 1. In the beginning God made Heaven and Earth;</hi> and the ſame work of Creation is here attribute to the Son, in the third following Verſe, all things are made by Him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the Senſe of theſe words <hi>in the Beginning,</hi> both in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and beginning of <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, is clearly this, as from the Beginning was the Word, and that Word was God, ſo is now and ay ſhall laſt; And as in the Beginning all things were made by Him, and ſo He was Eternal before the World that He made in the beginning of Time, as in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> God was Eternal before the making of the World, for to take any ſingle Propoſition in Scripture, and admit no Senſe to it but that which that one ſingle ſeparate Propoſition will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and ſo admit no further clearing of its Senſe from antecedent and conſequent Scriptures.

               <p>IN this fifth Chapter I intend to give a brief account of the Moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Perſection that the Church of Chriſt ſuffered from the remnant of <hi>Arians,</hi> and other <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> Blaſphemers, beginning

               <p>If it be objected, that ſeing, in the Church Hiſtory, and Councils, from the ſeventh Century to the fifteenth, there is only mention of two <hi>Antitrinitarian Hereticks,</hi> and conſequently theſe Blaſphemous Hereſies being now baniſhed, and buried; and ſeing it is granted, that the Doxology was firſt appointed to be ſung in the Church, by occaſion of <hi>Antitrinitarian Hereticks,</hi> for confirming in the Faith, the Lords People againſt their Blaſphemies, why then was it any longer continued after the cauſe was removed? I anſwer, becauſe the Church then perceived, by comfortable experience, that the conſtant ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Doxology in the Publick Worſhip of God, had proved an excellent mean, to confirm Chriſtians in the Doctrine, and Faith of the Trinity, and to guard them againſt the temptations of Satan, and his ſuppoſts, and their own corruption, who were all yet lying in wait, to blow at the Aſhes of the little ſpunks of the ſaid old Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that ſeemed to be buried many hundred years before.

                     <hi>The lawfulneſs of Singing the</hi> Doxology <hi>proven by theſe Arguments. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Christians are baptized in the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 2. They believe, or profeſs their Faith, in Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. 3. They believe Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier. 4. Their Faith, and Hope of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory, is from Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. 5. God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, made all things, and eſpecially for His Glory. 6. This Lord of Glory often calls Man's Tongue His Glory. 7. From the practice of the Saints and Angels. 8.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the former Chapters, I having deſcribed the occaſion upon which the Univerſal Church did appoint the ſinging of the Doxology, to wit, The abounding of Blaſphemers againſt the Trinity, proven in the firſt three Chapters. Secondly, The unanimous Agreement of the Church for ſinging the Doxology in the fourth Chapter, and the reaſon of its continuance in the Church to this day, even becauſe the Church ever ſince hath never altogether wanted ſome blaſphemous Hereticks within the Church, beſides the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Jew,</hi> both deniers of the Trinity without the Church. Follows the ſecond part of this Treatiſe, which is ſubdivided thus: Firſt, I prove by many Arguments the lawfulneſs of the ſinging of the Doxology, in the ſixth, ſeventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth Chapters: Secondly, I anſwer ſome Objections in the eleventh, and twelfth Chapters: Thirdly, I ſhow the many Evils from the refuſing to ſing the Doxology; Laſtly, I cloſe with an Exhortation to receive with all tenderneſs, all that ſhall return from their Errors.</p>
               <p>In this and ſome following Chapters, I have accumulate Arguments, becauſe, I ſupponed I did write to ſome Chriſtians weak in Knowledge, I ſay weak in Knowledge, becauſe I am loath to judge that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtrong in Knowledge will deny its lawfulneſs, unleſs their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſtrangely overclouded by prevalent Prejudice, and if any ſuch there be, we have alſo brought Arguments for their peruſing: We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with Arguments for the Weak.</p>
               <p>All who are baptized in the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, to them it is lawful to ſing Glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: But all Chriſtians are baptized in the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; therefore, to all Chriſtians it's lawful to ſing Glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51622:35"/>
               <p>Second Reaſon, All who believe and profeſs their Faith in Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, to them it's lawful to ſing Glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, but all Chriſtians throughout the World believe and profeſs Faith in Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, therefore it is lawful to all Chriſtians throughout the World to ſing Glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Third Reaſon, All who believe or profeſs that God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier; to them it is lawful to ſing Glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: But all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians believe and profeſs, that God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier; Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Fifth Reaſon, God Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, made all things for His own Glory, and Man's chief end is to glorifie God, the firſt words of the leſſer Catechiſm of the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Synod; Therefore it is lawful for Man to glorifie Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in a Song.</p>
               <p>Sixth Reaſon, God Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt hath given to Man his Tongue and Speech, that therewith he may glorifie God Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; Therefore, often in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> Mans Tongue is called his glory, <hi>Pſal. 57. 8.

               <p>Seventh Reaſon, That which is the practice of the Angels, and of all the Saints in Heaven and Earth, is lawful, but to ſing glory to God Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is the practice of the Angels, <hi>Luk. 2. 14. The heavenly hoſt ſang glory to God,</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 13. All in Heaven and in Earth did ſing glory to God.</p>
               <p>Eighth Reaſon, That which is commanded of God is lawful, but to ſing glory to God is commanded by God, I prove the aſſumption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 1, 2.

               <p>Ninth Reaſon, That which hath been the conſtitution and conſtant practice of the Univerſal Church theſe 1300. Years without ſcruple, or refuſal, and ſtill retained in all the reformed Churches, after their

               <p>Yea, ſeing the Creed retains the ſtyle Apoſtolick, becauſe of it's great Antiquity, ſo ſome of the learned incline to think, that the Doxology is alſo of Apoſtolick an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, for that it was uſed in the Church long before the <hi>Nicen</hi> Creed. It was proven by <hi>Baſils</hi> words, and <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who was a young Presbyter at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and there a great refuter of <hi>Arius,</hi> yet long before he dyed, <hi>Baſil</hi> writs diverſe Letters to him, <hi>Epiſt</hi> 47.

               <p>Some aſks the queſtion, upon what Text of Scripture the Doxology is chiefly founded, for anſwer: It hath two parts, to wit, The three Perſons of the Trinity, which are the object of that worſhip: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Glory given to them, which is the Act of worſhip in the Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, accordingly, the giving of Glory to God is founded on many Scriptures, but there is one full, and expreſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. the laſt <hi>verſe, Of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for

               <p>Thus we have proven from Scripture theſe parts of the Doxology, Glory to the Father, to the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, for now and ever: There remains one word to be cleared in the Doxology, to wit, <hi>As it was in the beginning,</hi> for clearing of which, we wrot in the end of the fourth Chapter, that theſe words were added to the Doxology, becauſe of <hi>Arian Hereticks,</hi> and that in the fourth Century, when <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> denyed that the Son was with the Father from all eternity, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that there was a time when the Son was not, and theſe Ancient Doctors of the Church, knowing that the firſt Words in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in theſe three Verſes, were indited by the Holy Ghoſt, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> his Pen-man, to aſſert the Co-eternity of the Son with the Father, and that againſt Ancient Hereticks, who lived in the Apoſtle St. <hi>John's</hi> time, and were Blaſphemers of Chriſt, the Church therefore hath made choiſe of that ſame Text, as fitteſt againſt the <hi>Arians</hi>

What are they ſinging? <hi>Bleſſing, honour, glory, and power.</hi> 3. To whom do they ſing this <hi>Doxologie?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>to him that ſits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb:</hi> And that the weak may better underſtand that there are two Perſons of the Godhead diſtinctly expreſt here, for them more clearly diſtinguiſhed in the 6. <hi>verſ.

But this Song in the <hi>Revelation</hi> 5. 9. I find not among the Scriptural Songs; why he omitted it, the reaſon I know not, but this I know, the Holy Ghoſt calls it a Song as expreſly as any in the Bible. 2. The ſingers are all Chriſtians. 3.

               </p>
               <p>The 14th reaſon that we bring, is from 1 <hi>Chron. 16. 29.

The Apoſtle ſpeaks of unreaſonable men, by which are meant the unbeliever, and unregenerat; For the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever his ſaving Faith clears up, and fortifies his reaſon: Therefore if thou be a furniſhed and true believer, and grant the truth of the firſt two ſentences of any one, or all the reaſons, then thou will aſſent to the third ſentence, which is, to ſing <hi>Glory to the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt;</hi> and if thou find thy heart inclining to conſent, then blow at that ſpunk that is kindled in thy ſoul by the Holy Ghoſt, and go to thy knees in all humility, ſincerity, and ſelf-denial, and beg of him to lead thee in all truth, and to ſhew thee the good and the right way, and whether it will tend more to the glory of God, to ſing <hi>Glory to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or to be dumb and ſilent, and ſay in your heart, I will not ſing glory to God, even when my fellow-Chriſtians are ſinging it.</p>
               <p>Do you believe with all your ſoul that God ſent his Son from Heaven to earth to bring you from earth to Heaven; that Chriſt ſuffered the ſorrows of death and hell, to ſave thee from endleſs torments, and will ye refuſe to ſing glory to him for ſo doing and ſuffering for you; If a poor brother of Jeſus were asking an alms from you, and you would not give him one mite, and yet would ſay at that ſame time to ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, if that poor man were going to Priſon, I would give him a great ſum of money to relieve him, would they believe you, or rather laugh you to ſcorn? So when you are deſired to ſing glory to the bleſſed Trinity, and ye refuſe to do it, who would believe you that you would ſuffer tormenting flames for the glory of that bleſſed Trinity. I know you will ſay you have ſome reaſons why you refuſe to ſing the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, but ye would have no reaſon to refuſe martyrdome? I anſwer, your corruption, that prompts you with excuſes to refuſe to ſing the Doxologie, which is the eaſier duty, would furniſh you with more excuſes to ſhun burning; ſo that ye who will not give God his due honour, to ſing glory to him, it is too like would never ſuffer mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome for him, and ſo the true ground of your refuſing is want of true Faith, <hi>Phil. 1. 29.

               <p>As for your pretences and excuſes you bring for not ſinging the Doxologie, lay it to heart, that your excuſes which your prejudged Conſcience it may be accepts of, ſo as to give you a ſeeming and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful peace for a time; yet truſt not that he who is greater then your Conſcience will accept of theſe excuſes, which in this life men who are blind, and partial Judges in their own cauſe thinks to be

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>TAke three Reaſons more to be pondered by the judicious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed Chriſtian, The firſt is thus grounded, the Worſhip of God conſiſts in two parts, either God ſpeaks to us, or we ſpeak to God; God ſpeaks to us in the Word, read, or exponed by Preaching; We ſpeak to God by Prayer, ſuiting things needful to Soul and Body, or by Praiſes of His infinite Excellencies, and for His Benefites. Theſe two laſt, to wit, Petitions or Praiſes, are either done without Song or in a Song; but ſo it is, that God in His infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs hath made the Chriſtian Worſhip in the New Teſtament to differ from the <hi>Jews</hi> Worſhip in the Old Teſtament, in fulneſs, clearneſs, and comfortableneſs; they had only the Old Teſtament, we have the New Teſtament added to it; they had the Old Teſtament read and exponed by the Church-men and Prophets, we have Old and New Teſtament both read, exponed and preached more plainly and fully to our greater ſaving Knowledge and Comfort, <hi>for the least in the kingdom of Heaven is greater then</hi> John Baptiſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 11. Secondly, Our Prayers and Praiſes of God in the New Teſtament are proportional to the Word read and preached, even more full, clear and comfortable then the <hi>Jew</hi> had in the Old Teſtament; but ſo it is that the obſtinate and impenitent <hi>Jew</hi> refuſed to joyn with us Chriſtians in any of theſe three parts of the Worſhip of God; they will not hear the Goſpel read, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51622:42"/> it is the Goſpel of Chriſt, whom they reject and blaſpheme; they will not hear the Word preached, becauſe <hi>we preach Chriſt crucified, which is to the</hi> Jews <hi>a ſtumbling-block,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23. Thirdly, They will not joyn with us in Prayer, for they refuſe to pray to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and they will ſeek nothing from God in the Name of Chriſt. Fourthly, They reject our Sacraments, for they refuſe to be baptized in the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, nor yet will they communicate with us, becauſe it is the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt: Seing then the all-wiſe Lord hath made the Chriſtian to differ from and excell the <hi>Jew</hi> in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in Preaching and Praying, is it not convenient and ſuitable to the other parts of our Chriſtian Worſhip, that we differ from them in our ſinging alſo, which is not a divers part of Worſhip diſtinct from Prayer and Praiſes without Song, but a divers manner of pronouncing it; for example, all that is in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> that is ſung to God with a Tone; it is lawful for a Chriſtian to worſhip God with theſe ſame words without a Tone or Song, in Prayer and Thankſgiving; ſo they differ not upon the matter, but in the manner of pronouncing them: But the adding of the Chriſtian Doxology to the cloſe of our ſinging of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> makes a ſuitable difference betwixt the Chriſtians ſinging of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> with the Doxology, and the <hi>Jew</hi> in their Worſhip ſinging the ſame <hi>Pſalm</hi> without the ſinging of the Chriſtian Doxology: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Is it convenient or decent, that a <hi>Jew</hi> who blaſphemes the Son of God, and denies the bleſſed Trinity, who are without the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, that they ſhall have it to ſay or brag, although I abhor to joyn with the Sow, (for ſo they call the Chriſtian,) nor will I hear their Goſpel read or preached, nor will I joyn with them in Prayer, (for they abhor the Name of Chriſt;) yet ſays the <hi>Jew,</hi> I will not abhor to joyn with them in ſinging the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> for they ſing nothing but the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> juſt as we do, they ſing in their Mother Tongue as we do in the <hi>Hebrew?</hi> would not the Chriſtian think himſelf affronted at the <hi>Jews</hi> offer, and if any in the Church refuſed to ſing the Doxology, he could ſay I am free to refuſe the Doxology as ſome of your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians refuſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many of the Pſalms cloſe with a Doxology or Praiſe to God, ſome one way ſome another, and this Doxology is moſt often in the laſt Verſe; but ſometimes in the <hi>penult</hi> Verſe, and then the laſt Verſe is ſome particular reaſon and ground given for that particular Doxology. Theſe who pleaſe to ſearch the <hi>Pſalms</hi> more diligently will find it ſo, to wit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. and 75. in their laſt and <hi>penult</hi> Verſes; and in all theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> following you may obſerve a particular Doxology in the laſt Verſe of every one of them, to wit, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 7, 8, 13, 21, 24, 26, 30, 35, 41, 45, 52, 57, 59, 61, 66, 68, 71, 72, 89, 97, 99, 100, 103, 111, 118, 124, 136, 140, 145. and beſides, there are other <hi>Pſalms</hi> that all cloſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51622:42"/> with one and the ſame Doxology, to wit, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord. Pſalm 104, 105, 106, 115, 116, 117, 135, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150. Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah,</hi> and in the Book of the <hi>Revelation, chap.</hi> 19. three Companies end their Praiſes to God with that ſame <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> retaining the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Text. The firſt Company much People, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3. cloſe their Praiſes with <hi>Hallelujah.</hi> Secondly, The twenty four Elders, and four living Creatures, in the ſecond Chore, cloſe <hi>Amen, Hallelujah.</hi> Thirdly, Another great multitude, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. being commanded, give their <hi>Hallelujah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as many of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> cloſe with a Doxology, ſo ſome of the ſcriptural Songs, as <hi>Exodus 15. 18. Iſaiah 12. 6. Iſaiah 38. 20. Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi> 3. 18, and 19. 1 <hi>Chronicles</hi> 16. 36. Now, as in the Old Teſtament the Lord had teached the <hi>Jews</hi> to cloſe their Songs and Pſalms with a Doxology, (for in them I find a Doxology about fourty eight times,) ſo in the New Teſtament, ſeing it hath pleaſed God to reveal Himſelf more fully then He was pleaſed to do in the Old Teſtament to the <hi>Jew,</hi> and make the Doctrine of the Trinity the badge of Chriſtian Baptiſm, and that Doctrine being ſo much oppoſed and blaſphemed by <hi>Jews, Turks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ſhall it not then be lawful and expedient for the Chriſtian, now the only Church of God, to cloſe their Pſalms with ſuch a Doxology as may not only be a confeſſion of their Faith in that great fundamental of the Trinity, and foundation of Chriſtianity, but alſo to diſcern the true Chriſtian Church from the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogue, who are now <hi>Lo-ammi</hi> and <hi>Lo-ruhamah,</hi> Hoſ. 1. 6, 9. and ſo diſtinguiſh them from all other Meetings who pretend to worſhip the true God, and are but Antichriſtian Synagogues of Satan, and Blaſphemers of the glorious Trinity.</p>
               <p>The laſt Reaſon may be thus grounded, Amongſt the ten ſeveral Names whereby God (in the Old Teſtament) hath been pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign Himſelf, <hi>Jehovah Elohim</hi> are the two chief: Firſt, <hi>Jehovah</hi> is <note place="margin">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51622:43"/> Old Teſtament, who themſelves undoubtedly did know the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Trinity, as <hi>Moſes, David, Iſaiah,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore when they did ſo often write theſe two Names of God together <hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> the firſt being the Singular Number, the ſecond the Plural, did thereby intimate the Unity of the Eſſence in the Godhead with the Trinity of Perſons; therefore <hi>Pareus</hi> on <hi>Geneſis, pag.</hi> 23. having diſpute the queſtion, at length concludes, <hi>No godly Man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the probability of this reaſon drawen from</hi> Elohim, <hi>joined with another word of the Singular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as it is here with</hi> Jehovah; and ſo think the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Synod Notes, on the firſt two words of <hi>Geneſis, Elohim Bara,</hi> the firſt <hi>Elohim</hi> being in the Plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber jovned with <hi>Bara</hi> in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Number, <hi>He did creat;</hi> and that <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the reſt of the Pen-men of the Holy Scriptures in the Old Teſtament did know this Myſtery, is out of queſtion to the Doctors, both of the Reformed and <hi>Roman</hi> Church, all which, with the Fathers and Councils, bring many ſtrong and clear Arguments from the Old Teſtament to prove the Myſtery of the Sacred Trinity: Therefore <hi>Tremellius,</hi> a Jew born, in his Notes upon <hi>Gen. 1. 26. Let us make Man after our own image,</hi> ſaith God; Note this here, God Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, one God in three diſtinct Perſons ſo appoint; <hi>Let us,</hi> here ſaith <hi>Tremellius</hi> is a Teſtimony of the Sacred Trinity, and that not an obſcure one: And therefore the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Notes prove from the Scriptures, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not ignorant of the Doctrine of the Trinity; and it is obſervable, that in the firſt three Chapters of <hi>Geneſis, Moſes</hi> nineteen times calls God <hi>Jehovah Elohim;</hi> and who will deny that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſts day, <hi>John</hi> 8. 56. and did not <hi>David</hi> call Him Lord, when in the Spirit of Prophecy he ſpake of Him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 44. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw His Glory, <hi>John</hi> 12. 41. And if ſome object, If there be ſo many clear Teſtimonies in the Old Teſtament of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51622:44"/> Doctrine of the Trinity, how came it to paſs that now the <hi>Jews</hi> who have, and read the Old Teſtament, deny the Sacred Trinity? The Scriptures will anſwer you, our Saviour in the Goſpel pronounces them blind, <hi>Mat. 15. 14. the blind lead the blind,</hi> and often elſewhere, and ſo the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7. were they not broken off for their Unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. till the fulneſs of the Gentiles come in; and ſince their rejection and breaking off, the Vail is on their Eyes until this day while they read the Old Teſtament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. yet it will not follow, but that the Myſtery of the Trinity was known to the Saints, and ſaved in the Old Teſtament, who believed the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, <hi>the ſeed of the Woman ſhould tread down the head of the Serpent,</hi> which our bleſſed Saviour was to the Saints in the Old Teſtament, as well as to us <hi>the Way, the Truth and the Life,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. <hi>and the ſame to day, yeſterday, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. So that as the believing <hi>Jews</hi> and Church of God in the Old Teſtament, did believe the Doctrine of the Trinity (albeit we grant that that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Trinity was not ſo clearly revealed to theſe Saints in the Old Teſtament, as it is now to us Chriſtians under the New Teſtament) aſſerted to them in many Teſtimonies of Scripture; ſo they, reading and hearing the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, which was their Mother Language, and therein two Names of God ſo often joyned together <hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> the one in the Singular, the other in the Plural Number, the Holy Ghoſt and His Pen-men did thereby inſinuate to them the Doctrine of the Sacred Trinity; and according to this, in many of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Pſalms, and ſome Spiritual Songs, there is a Doxology to <hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> cloſing the Pſalm, to wit, theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> following, 76, 80, 84, 90, 92, 99, 144, 146, and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 36. and <hi>Chap. 29. verſ.</hi> 20. and <hi>Pſal. 72. verſ.</hi> 18, and 19. If then the <hi>Jew</hi> cloſed many Pſalms with the Doxology to the bleſſed Trinity, ſhall not the Chriſtian, to whom the Myſtery is more clearly revealed, and in which he is baptized, and without which he cannot be ſaved, (for no Salvation without Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12.) and he who denieth the Son hath not the Father, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 23. and as the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father and the Son, <hi>Job.</hi> 15. 26. ſo he who hath not the Spirit of the Father and Son dwelling in him is none of Chriſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. therefore the <hi>Jew, Turk,</hi> and <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> Hereticks, who are aſhamed of the Name of Chriſt in this Life, Chriſt will be aſhamed of them when He comes in His Glory with His holy Angels, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38. But for us Chriſtians, let us not be aſhamed to believe and confeſs to our Salvation, and give Glory to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and with that Doxology to cloſe the Pſalm with it all our life, yea, alſo cloſe our days with it on the Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, following the example of that ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 72. which he ſang at the cloſe of his days, a Prayer for his ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> a Prayer full of comfort and faith in the Son of God, this Pſalm he cloſes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51622:44"/> with a Doxology to <hi>Jehovah Elohim, ver. 18. Bleſſed be</hi> Jehovah Elohim, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and bleſſed be His glorious Name for ever and ever, and let the whole Earth be filled with His glory,</hi> Amen, <hi>and</hi> Amen. So, as the <hi>Jew</hi> had their Doxology Glory to <hi>Jehovah Elohim</hi> for ever, and we have <hi>Elohim</hi> more clearly manifeſted, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, then ſhall it not be lawful for Chriſtians to ſing Glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt for ever.</p>
               <p>For further clearing <hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> its intimating the Doctrine of the Trinity, as I have obſerved in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that theſe two Names of God when put together, eſpecially in the Prophets, are moſt ordinarily uſed (although not always) upon one of theſe two occaſions, Firſt, When the Lord is to difference and contradiſtinguiſh Himſelf from all falſe and <hi>Pagan</hi> gods, and then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily it is rendered in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible, <hi>the Lord my God,</hi> or <hi>thy God,</hi> or <hi>the Lord our God,</hi> or <hi>your God.</hi> Secondly, It is uſed when the Lord is giving to His Church ſome notable Promiſe of a great Deliverance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodily or ſpiritual in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſo an evangelick Promiſe, and both theſe ways <hi>Jehovah Elohim</hi> intimats a Trinity, for the <hi>Pagans</hi> all confeſſed a Deity, but none of them Trinity in Unity. As for affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jehovah-Elohim</hi> to evangelick Promiſes in the Old Teſtament, it might be the moſt proper Name to inſinuate a Trinity which was to be yet more clearly manifeſted in the Goſpel; were it not that I intend brevity, I could inſtance both theſe, and clear them from many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Old Teſtament.</p>

Firſt, It is clear from the light ol Nature, becauſe many learned Pagans, who had no more but the light of Nature, did ſing holy Hymns of praiſe to their gods; this is abundantly clear in Humane Hiſtory, and undenyable. Secondly, The Holy Scriptures are full of it, eſpecially the Book of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> commanding us to ſing praiſes to God; now this proves infallibly the general, that it is lawful to ſing glory to God: Which Concluſion being proven, I make up a ſecond Reaſon, and takes the proven Concluſion for the Major; and I reaſon thus, It is unqueſtionably lawful to ſing glory to God, I aſſume, God is Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; then it is unqueſtionably lawful to ſing <hi>Glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and if any think themſelves ſtrong, and being under prejudice, are not ſatisfied with this reaſon, I would ask them if their Infant-Baptiſm was not an act of lawful Worſhip, and done in faith of the Miniſter that Baptized, and of their Parent that required and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Sacrament for their uſe; in both which I judge the Miniſter conſecrat and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51622:45"/> the Sacrament lawfully, and their Parents lawfully received them from the Laver of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and yet I would gladly know from theſe that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſinging the <hi>Doxologie,</hi> becauſe it is not expreſs in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Chriſtian ſing <hi>glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> why then do they not reject their Infant-baptiſm becauſe it is not expreſs in Scripture <hi>Baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> but well proven to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by neceſſary conſequence from Scripture, which with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church we think a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for Infant-baptiſm. And what is the cauſe that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedobaptiſts</hi> have fallen in that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and ſeparat from the true Church? Even becauſe they were too deep in that opinion, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not ſufficient warrand for an act of religious Worſhip, of which error ye would be aware, leſt it draw you into other great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er errors then you are aware of.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN this Chapter, we are to anſwer the Grand Objection, to wit, That the ſinging of the Doxology in the publick worſhip of God, was laid aſide by the Generall Aſſembly of this Church, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1649. To this my firſt anſwer is, that Aſſembly hath fourty two Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions mentioned in the Index of the imprinted Acts thereof, but the laying aſide of the Doxology is not mentioned in the Printed Acts of that Aſſembly, nor yet in the index of the imprinted Acts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeing there is no mention in the Regiſter of the Church, to prove to Poſterity, that the Doxology was laid aſide, it may put ſome to demurr in that affair, ſeing there is no legal proof of it extant. 2<hi>dly.</hi> I anſwer, though the laying aſide of the Doxology was <hi>res geſta,</hi> yet ſeing there is not a word of it in the Regiſter of the Church, the laying of it aſide, will come under the Notion of an unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to Poſterity, 3<hi>dly.</hi> I anſwer, That it is to be conſidered whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not the Generall Aſſembly was <hi>in poteſtate,</hi> and had lawfull power to lay aſide the Doxology, for in their National Covenant, they grant their Religion as reformed, at the firſt expelling of Idolatry, and was Ratified in <hi>Parliament,</hi> in <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1560. And it's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith to be Chriſts true and perfect Religion, that they ſhal adhere to it all their dayes, to which they bind themſelves with Solemn and fearfull Curſes; but ſo it is, That at the ſaid Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the Lyturgy then appointed, and Printed at the beginning of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> Book, <hi>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, as it was in the beginning, is now, and aye ſhall laſt,</hi> is extant
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51622:47"/> in Print; yea, in that <hi>Pſalm</hi> Book of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> of the old Edition, there is great variety of the Meeter Poeſies and leſt any of them having their diverſe Tune ſhould want the Doxology ſung at the cloſe of it, each of theſe diverſe Poeſies have a diverſe Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology one in ſubſtance with the ordinar Doxology, but differing in ſome words, being framed to be ſung according to the particular mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Tunes all which Doxologies were in uſe in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> after the Reformation, which Book is yet extant Printed at <hi>Aberdeen cum privilegio,</hi> in <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1638. So that the National Covenant compared with our firſt Reformation engadgeth us in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> not to quite the Doxology, under the pain of perjury; as for that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Lyturgy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was Printed, and bound in with the <hi>Pſalm</hi> Book, it was drawn up by the General Aſſembly, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1560. and 1555 and 1567.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Anſwer, The General Aſſembly, 1639. <hi>August</hi> 30. Which day, that Aſſembly hath enacted, thus. <hi>The General Aſſembly conſidering, that the intended Reformation being recovered, may be establiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Ordains, that no Innovation, which may diſturbe the peace of the Church, and make diviſion, be ſuddenly proponed, or enacted but ſo as the motion be firſt communicat to the ſeverall Synods, Presbytries, and Churches, that the matter may be approven by all at home, and Commisſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners may come well prepared, unanimouſly to conclude with ſettled deliberation upon theſe points, in the general Aſsembly:</hi> Which Act of Aſſembly, as it was prudently made, ſo accordingly practiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, for in the General Aſſembly, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1642. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. There are four Overtures Printed with the Acts of that Aſſembly to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by Preſbyters againſt the next Aſſembly; So that his laudable Act was carefully obeyed in other things but not ſo in laying aſide the Doxology: For it was done abruptly, without the knowledge, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement of particular Churches, Preſbytries or Synods, who ſhould have been acquainted before and canvaſſed the matter, before any thing had been determined in the General Aſſembly anent the Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the laying of it aſide, which was an innovation ſuddenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, and inſtantly paſſed to the diſcomforming diviſion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all tranſmarin Proteſtants, yea, and from the univerſal Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In the Solemn League and Covenant of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> approven by the General Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland, Anno. Dom. 1643. Auguſt</hi> 17. In the ſaid League and Covenant, with hands lifted up to the moſt high God, they ſwear ſincerely, and conſtantly to endeavour the preſervation of the Reformed Religion in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Worſhip (but then the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their Worſhip did ſing the Doxology,) to endeavour the Reformation of Religion in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in Worſhip, &amp;c. according to the Example of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51622:48"/> beſt Reformed Churches. but then, and to this day the beſt Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches did uſe, and ſtill uſe the Doxology in the Worſhip of God, as is to be ſeen in the particular <hi>Pſalm</hi> Books, in <hi>Helvetia, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. Here in the Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, are two tyes on the Covenanters in both Nations to uſe the Doxology.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The ſame General Aſſembly, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1643 After their approbation of the League and Covenant, in their Anſwer to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Divines in <hi>England Auguſt</hi> 19 Writ thus, <hi>That you may be more cloſely united to the beſt Reformed Churches in Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. But ſo it was, that <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the beſt Reformed Churches, did then, and to this day uſe the Doxology, and in another Letter of the ſaid Aſſembly, to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> they writ thus, <hi>That the Purpoſe, and End of the League and Covenant, is, for ſetling, and holding faſt of Unity and Uniformity betwixt the Churches of this</hi> Iſland, <hi>and the beſt Reformed Churches beyond Sea;</hi> but all theſe Churches beyond Seas, did then, and ſtill does to this day ſing the Doxology, then ſurely the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> even after their taking the League and Covenant, as it did tye them to keep the Doxology, ſo they ſincerely purpoſed to keep it, and their practice was conform.</p>

               <p>I bring this Reaſon, to wit. As the General Aſſembly of this Church did bind up their own hands from laying aſide the Doxology, by both Covenants, and many Acts of General Aſſemblies beſide, ſo there are Reaſons brought from the ſubſtance of their deed to invalid at the ſame, as <hi>Firſt,</hi> there is a Rule in the Word of God, <hi>Whether ye eat, or ye drink, do all to the glory of God,</hi> Then every Church Act ſhould be done to the Glory of God, then the tenor of this Church Act muſt come to this, for the Glory of God, we lay aſide ſinging Glory to God Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, this is a hard ſaying, and like a Paradox, <hi>For he that offereth praiſe, glorifieth me,</hi> Pſalm 50 13.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We challenge the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that they lean too much

Their laying aſide of the <hi>Doxologie</hi> would appear not to have been done cordially, but becauſe of the importunity of theſe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for albeit they had received the Directory, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1645. at which time theſe in <hi>England</hi> left the <hi>Doxologie,</hi> who had imbraced the <hi>Directory;</hi> yet for all that importunity from <hi>England,</hi> the General Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland</hi> did not lay aſide the <hi>Doxologie</hi> until <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1649. and when it was mentioned by the Moderator of the General Aſſembly to be laid aſide, Mr. <hi>David Calderwood,</hi> an aged man, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of great experience, and of unqueſtionable integrity, as to theſe times, ſpoke to the hearing of the whole Synod. <hi>Moderator, I intreat that the Doxologie be not laid aſide, for I hope to ſing it in Heaven,</hi> to which ſpeech he received no ſatisfactory anſwer; and I doubt not but many in that Synod by their ſilence did approve his ſaying, as a ſound and ſeaſonable teſtimony in favours of the Doxologie; and I do not remember that the Doxologie was laid aſide by a formal ſuffrage of the whole Synod, by calling of the Roll; only ſome next the Moderator gave their conſent: and howſoever, the not Regiſtrating of this deed cannot be imputed to the ſloath of their Clerk; for theſe who were acquaint with theſe times know well that they were not ſloathful in buſineſs, but ſervent in ſpirit. But it ſeems ſtrange to me that ſome in the General Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland</hi> in that year, 1649. could have ſo ſtrong hopes of a comfortable union with <hi>England</hi> in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and upon that account to lay aſide the Doxologie to pleaſe them, when the General Aſſembly, <hi>Anno 1648.

               <p>As for theſe Brethren in <hi>England</hi> who requeſted the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in <hi>Scotland</hi> to lay aſide the ſinging of the Doxologie, no doubt they had taken the League and Covenant, and on this account are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Brethren;</hi> but in that Covenant they did ſolemnly vow and ſwear to Almighty God to reform Religion according to the beſt reformed Churches; but all the reformed Churches have ſtill retained the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, why then did not theſe Brethren in <hi>England</hi> fear that Oath, <hi>the mark of the truly godly, Eccl.</hi> 9. 2. And if any would thus excuſe them, that they were perſwaded by ſuch ſtrong reaſons as they thought libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from their Oath, in regard of ſinging the Doxologie, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, granting that it is poſſible they had ſuch thoughts, as may be in charity ſupponed: To which I reply, If they had, as they thought, ſuch ſtrong reaſons convincing themſelves, then they were bound to impart that new and rare light unknown to the univerſal Church for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51622:50"/> more then 1300. years, they ſhould have imparted that ſpiritual gift, and not hid that talent of knowledge in their Napkin, nor ſet their Candle under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick, to give light to all the houſe, not only of the reformed, but even of the univerſal Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be thought that they were obliged to clear themſelves of giving offence in ſeparating from the Reformed Churches, contrary to their Covenant, and quitting the Doxologie without ſo much as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering one reaſon for their making a breach from the reformed Churches in their uniformity in Worſhip, which they did ſwear in their Covenant.</p>
               <p>I am alſo ſorry that with their quitting of the Doxologie, theſe in <hi>England</hi> did alſo quite both the ſolemn bleſſings in the Old and New Teſtament which the Reformed Church uſeth in the cloſing of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip that they would neither give God his due, nor his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; not him his ſolemn glory, nor them their ſolemn bleſſing, and ſo they have not left a bleſſing behind them, and it is like their way hath not been the more bleſſed in their deed: for as their laying aſide of the Apoſtolick bleſſing, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 13, 14. (which Text the univerſal Church taketh for one of the chief Texts in the Word-of God for prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great fundamental point of faith of the Sacred Trinity) So the univerſal Church had made uſe of the Doxologie theſe many hundred years bygone, as a ſtrong preſervative againſt ſeducing of people to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour anent the Trinity.</p>
               <p>As for the General Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as they piouſly, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, in theſe unſettled and reeling times, retained both the bleſſings of the Old and New Teſtament in their Publick Worſhip, with the reſt of the reformed Churches: So it was a good preſage that in the Lords good time they would re-aſſume and ſing glory to the bleſſed Trinity with the reſt of the reformed and univerſal Church, as now they do at this day, for which we give glory to the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51622:56"/> that they differed in ſome ſmaller particulars; of which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in his Church Hiſtory, <hi>lib. 5. cap.</hi> 21. writes at length, which the Learned know, yet there are ſome things belonging to the Church of ſo weighty and important concernment, that the univerſal Church judged it no wayes expedient that particular Churches ſhould be left to their own choiſe, but that the univerſal Church ſhould agree upon one certain way wherein all particular Churches might keep uniformity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of Gods Word, for order, and decency, and peace; and therefore the learned know what contentions fell out in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Century, betwixt the Church in the Weſt, and the Churches in leſſer <hi>Aſia;</hi> for theſe in leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> kept their Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> the ſame day that the <hi>Jews</hi> kept their Paſsover; but the Chriſtians in the Weſt kept their Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon the firſt Sabbath day thereafter: And albeit in this mean time the foreſaid Weſt and Eaſt Churches their judgement and practice was diverſe upon that matter, yet on both ſides they who were ſtrong in knowledge ſtill kept Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one with the other, as <hi>Socrates</hi> proves learnedly in the foreſaid Book and Chapter, ſo that <hi>Polycarpus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> afterwards a glorious Martyr of Jeſus Chriſt, albeit he did celebrat <hi>Eaſter</hi> in that ſame day with the <hi>Jews</hi> Paſsover, as ordinarily did all his Neighbour Biſhops in leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet coming to <hi>Rome</hi> he Communicat with their Biſhop upon their Chriſtian Sabbath day, which differed from his day of giving the Communion at home; but becauſe there is infirmity and weakneſs in many Chriſtians, therefore after that diverſe day of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Easter</hi> raiſed ſuch broils and contentions betwixt the Eaſt and Weſt Church, that there was no viſible nor ſeaſible way for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fearful rent and ſchiſm in the univerſal Church, until the general Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did appoint all to keep one day, which the univerſal Church hath kept ever ſince; therefore <hi>Beza</hi> in his 24. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> and 14. § thereof, diſtinguiſheth well betwixt Eccleſiaſtick conſtitutions, ſome are univerſal, ſome particular, and without all controverſie the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Doxologie is of univerſal conſtitution; for as we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from antiquity of Fathers, and Councils, the ſinging of the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie was the practice and judgement of the univerſal Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the univerſal Church reſolved to keep <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon a differing day from the <hi>Jew,</hi> who crucified the Lord of glory, and ſtill blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes him, as <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great inſinuats in his pious Letters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> ſo that ſame univerſal Church reſolved to keep the Doxologie, as a teſtimony againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> and all ſuch blaſphemous <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> Hereticks.</p>
               <p>Then to apply, the ſinging of the Doxologie is like the keeping of <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the Chriſtian Sabbath day, and not with the Jew on their day, to which both the Civil Magiſtrat by their Authority, and the Church by their Spiritual Authority did agree at the Council of <hi>Nice:</hi> as for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51622:56"/> that Text which we cited, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. of Chriſtians in two contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions about meat and dayes; the Civil Magiſtrat nor Church had not as yet interponed their Authority, but it was ſtill Arbitrary for the Magiſtrats external power, they being then all Pagans, to them both the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Religion were accounted ſuperſtition about words and names, as ſaid the Pagan Magiſtrat, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 19. and they thought it below them to take notice of theſe things: as for the Church Authority, which was then Apoſtolick, the Learned know the reaſon why they did not determine theſe queſtions of meats and dayes, becauſe there was a time allotred of <hi>interim</hi> betwixt the death and honourable burial of the Jews Ceremonies, which time of their honourable burial was not yet expired: and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> was written in this <hi>interim,</hi> during which time the Jewiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of meats and dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were <hi>mortui</hi> to the ſtrong Chriſtian Jew, and they were freed of their yoak, by taking on Chriſts eaſie yoak, and to the weak Chriſtian Jew who was not clear to quite theſe Ceremonies as yet during this <hi>interim</hi> they were indifferent, and not <hi>mortiferi:</hi> So that place foreſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. I fear be miſapplyed by theſe that refuſe to ſing the Doxologie; for the caſe alters in this, the Doxologie is determined to be uſed both by the univerſal Church, and all civil Chriſtian Powers, but theſe meats and dayes when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Romans,</hi> were yet left arbitrary, therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe weak Chriſtians for their ignorance, in not eating: but how much more bitterly had he reproved and condemned them if their not eating had been a breach of the command of the Church and State, as now it is in refuſing to ſing the Doxologie? Yet as the ſinging of the Doxologie agreed upon by the univerſal Church differs from the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the Chriſtian Sabbath, and not on the Jewiſh Sabbath, in two particulars; 1. The univerſal Church did more then 200. years differ in keeping the Chriſtian <hi>Eaſter;</hi> but all that time not one <hi>iota</hi> of objection or ſcruple againſt the ſinging of the Doxologie. 2. The Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing Act of difference of keeping <hi>Eaſter,</hi> was but once in the year, but the refuſing to ſing the Doxologie is a ſcandal every weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>This your refuſing to ſing the Doxologie, which the univerſal Church judgeth to be lawful and expedient, is offenſive and evil both to theſe within, and theſe without the Church; for theſe within the Church I make this Hypotheſis, that there being many thouſand Proteſtants beyond Seas who hear that ſome in <hi>Scotland</hi> have made a ſeparation from their Mother Church, and yet theſe ſame beyond Seas do not ſtudy the particular grounds, or pretended cauſes of that ſeparation; yet theſe ſame perſons being certainly informed that theſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> ſeparation, among other differences, refuſe to ſing the Doxologie; which refuſal of theirs is ſo notorious in their Publick Worſhip, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51622:57"/> it is like the Oyntment upon the right hand which cannot be hid. Then what will Proteſtant Strangers over Seas conclude? Even this, that ſeing there is in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſome who without juſt cauſe have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the Doxologie, contrary to the judgement and practice of the univerſal Church, then it is very like that their other pretences for their ſeparation are as unwarrantable; this refuſing to ſing the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie is alſo evil to theſe without the Church; which I thus illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, a <hi>Turk, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> being in the way of converſion to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and having learned that there is one God, and three Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, for in this Name he is to be baptized; and being thereafter informed that theſe ſame men who are to Baptize him refuſe to ſing <hi>Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in their Publick Worſhip; in what a demurr and doubtful perplexity would that <hi>Turk</hi> be?

               <p>To cloſe this Chapter, as Mr. <hi>Calderwood</hi> ſaid, in great zeall, in that foreſaid General Aſſembly, That he hoped to ſing the Doxology in Heaven; So let no Chriſtian think it a paradox, for the learned do know, that it may be proven by ſound Divinity, for, if in Heaven, our praiſes to God ſhall be perfect (which is moſt ſurely true) then we ſhall praiſe him in all his Attributs, in all his mighty Acts, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Word, and everlaſting Goſpel, then we ſhall eternally glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the infinitly glorious Eſſence, in the myſterious Trinity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for ſeing in Heaven there will be neither Petition, nor Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor Preaching, which make up a great part of our worſhip on earth, and ſo all our worſhip in Heaven ſhall be praiſes, and that to all Eternity; and ſeing our knowledge of God in Heaven ſhall be far more perfect then it was on Earth, and then we ſhall ſee God face to face, and know him in Eſſence, and Perſons more perfectly then we do now on Earth, and conſequently, our love to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt much more perfect, ſo the perfection of our praiſes and inceſſantneſſe, without wearing, ſhall anſwer to our greateſt perfection

               <p>If any pleaſe to object, the Church appointed the Doxology to be ſung, to guard the Flocks of Chriſt againſt <hi>Antitrinitarian Hereticks,</hi> but in Heaven there is no danger, for no Devil, nor <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> will be there to tempt, and the glorified Saints will be made perfect in Holineſſe, I anſwer, when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6. 2, 3.

Yea thirdly, It may be waved if it be beyond the ſphere of the Larger Catechiſm, for Queſtionators that furniſhes their common Diſcourſe with Queſtions, are unſavoury company to the Godly, and the weak Chriſtian ſhould not be entertained by the ſtrong Chriſtian with Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; it is expreſsly againſt the Apoſtles rule, <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not unto doubtful diſputations,</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. then let neither ſtrong nor weak Chriſtian (eſpecially in Company) move any queſtion of Religion, eſpecially theſe that belong to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Differences, leaſt the Strong touch the Weak on the old Sore, and ſo but grieve and irritate, which no doubt grieves the Spirit of God, and is not the healing way: As for the Weak, I intreat them who have been wandring in Miſtakes, to reſolve in the ſtrength of Chriſt, in all time hereafter, to live orderly as to the Church, and

And although ſome churliſh elder Brother (like <hi>Eliab</hi> too young <hi>David)</hi> would unchriſtianly chide thee, take courage, it is not that bitter Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe thou art coming home to, but thy Fathers; meditate and think on theſe things, for to be a ready antidote againſt the bitter Pills of ſome; and albeit ſome of the ſtronger Brethren be not ſo kindly, comfort thy ſelf here is thy Father pleading for thee, and ſo is thy elder Brother in this ſame <hi>Chap.
